# ASFKeyFormater
Format's Keys in the format "!r {account} {list,of,keys,seperated,by,commas}"

This program is for my personal use but you may find use out of it.
It is for use with ArchiSteamFarm to format a bunch of Steam Keys to output 
them in the format "!r {account} {list,of,keys,seperated,by,commas}"

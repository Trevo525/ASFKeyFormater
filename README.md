This is something I made when I was trying to learn C#. It was more of a learning excersize than anything useful. I am not 100% sure, but this might actually be the first application I made outside of `hello-world`, or some random code that was just playing and never was saved.

Either way, this is useless to me now. I use [this](https://github.com/umaim/SKE) now.
